Title: Clustering and pathway analysis using exponential distributions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Anooj Arkatkar
Maintainer: Anooj Arkatkar <arkatkar@msu.edu>
Description: Clustering and pathway analysis of omics data is performed by
    the use of an exponentially distributed association/dissimilarity measure.
    This package assumes null-distributed inter-cluster associations and forms 
    pathways that minimize any null-distributed linking associations between
    elements.
